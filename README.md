# MarketPlace

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/market_place`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Usage

Run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```
$ bundle
$ exe/market_place start
```

Run `help` to view the available options:

```
$ exe/market_place --help
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
